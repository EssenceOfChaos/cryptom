# CRYPTOM

Cryptom is a side project I've been working on for awhile, aimed at bringing cryptocurrency to the masses. The mission of cryptom is multifaceted. The main objectives are to **educate** people about the benefits of crypto. To  **facilitate** transactions between crypto and fiat. And finally, **integrate** crypto into social apps to take advantage of new opportunities like crowd-funding, micro-funding, fully automated smart contracts, multi-signature smart contracts, and much more.

Things you may want to cover:

* I've been building the application on Ruby 2.4, Rails 5.0.2

* The Database I've chosen to use is MongoDB
