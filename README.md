# CRYPTOM

Cryptom is a side project I've been working on for awhile, aimed at bringing cryptocurrency to the masses. The mission of cryptom is multifaceted. The main objectives are to **educate** people about the benefits of crypto. To  **facilitate** transactions between crypto and fiat. And finally, **integrate** crypto into social apps to take advantage of new opportunities like crowd-funding, micro-funding, fully automated smart contracts, multi-signature smart contracts, and much more.

## Overview

* The application is built on Ruby 2.4, Rails 5.0.2

* The Database is MongoDB

* Check out the current live version [here](http://cryptom.space)

* Feel free to submit a PR

### Project => Company

* This project may have multiple contributors at the time it develops a revenue stream. I believe the project's ownership should be assigned by a system of *founders equity*. A multi-signature wallet should be created assigning the developers equity based on their contributions to the project. This would allow the business to be autonomous with decentralized control.
